config BUZZER_ENABLE
    bool "Enable Buzzer"
    default y
    help
      Enable this option to include the buzzer component in your project.
      This allocates a GPIO pin and PWM timer. Disable to save resources.

config BUZZER_GPIO
    int "GPIO pin for buzzer"
    depends on BUZZER_ENABLE
    default 13
    help
      Specify the GPIO pin number to be used for the buzzer's PWM output.
      Ensure this pin is not in use by any other component.

config BUZZER_FREQ
    int "Buzzer frequency (Hz)"
    depends on BUZZER_ENABLE
    default 2000
    help
      Set the frequency of the PWM signal. For a passive buzzer, this value
      determines the pitch. For an active buzzer, a value in the 1-5 kHz
      range is recommended to avoid audible buzzing artifacts.

config BUZZER_DUTY
    int "LEDC duty (0-8191)"
    depends on BUZZER_ENABLE
    default 4095
    help
      Set the duty cycle for the PWM signal. The value is based on the 13-bit
      resolution of the LEDC timer. A value of 4095 results in a 50% duty cycle.
