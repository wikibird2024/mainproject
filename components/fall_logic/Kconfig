config FALL_LOGIC_ENABLE
    bool "Enable fall detection logic"
    default y
    help
        Enable or disable the fall detection functionality.
        When enabled, the system will periodically analyze
        accelerometer data to detect possible falls.

config FALL_LOGIC_THRESHOLD_G
    int "Fall detection threshold (mg)"
    default 400
    range 100 800
    depends on FALL_LOGIC_ENABLE
    help
        The acceleration threshold in milli-g (mg) used to
        identify a fall event. A value of 400mg (0.4g) is a
        good default. During freefall, total acceleration drops
        significantly, typically near 0g.

config FALL_LOGIC_CHECK_INTERVAL_MS
    int "Sensor polling interval (ms)"
    default 150
    range 50 500
    depends on FALL_LOGIC_ENABLE
    help
        The interval in milliseconds between sensor checks.
        Shorter intervals increase responsiveness but use more CPU.
        Default is 150ms for a good balance.

config FALL_LOGIC_TASK_STACK_SIZE
    int "Fall logic task stack size (bytes)"
    default 4096
    depends on FALL_LOGIC_ENABLE
    help
        Stack size for the FreeRTOS task responsible for
        processing fall detection logic.

config FALL_LOGIC_TASK_PRIORITY
    int "Fall logic task priority"
    default 5
    depends on FALL_LOGIC_ENABLE
    help
        Priority of the FreeRTOS task handling fall detection.
        Higher values increase task precedence over others.
